# The Ripening

The Ripening is a shooter game where players play as a clock and shoot produce (e.g. avocados and bananas). Once the produce ripens, it will expire and the player receives points for ripening the fruit. After one fruit expires, two more spawn to take its place. As more enemies spawn, they give the impression of a zombie-like produce hoard approaching the player.
